Research conducted in the Li Lab encompasses the fields of ecology, evolution, and biogeography. At the heart of our work lies a passionate commitment to understanding the complexities of biodiversity, exploring processes of diversification, and unraveling the mechanisms driving species coexistence. Our investigations span vast spatiotemporal scales, with a particular focus on plant and mountain systems. From dissecting the impacts of global change on species distributions to unraveling the formation and persistence of biodiversity hotspots, our research endeavors are diverse and dynamic. We delve into questions surrounding niche evolution, ecological speciation, and local adaptation, employing cutting-edge techniques to shed light on these fascinating phenomena.
