I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Richard Ree](www.reelab.net) at the Field Museum of Natural History. I am generally interested in ecology, evolution, and biogeography. My research focuses on understanding patterns of biodiversity in nature and processes of diversification in a changing environment, with a combination of techniques: theory, comparative methods, modeling, and field studies.

Currently I am working on floristic structure and environmental correlates at the Hengduan Mountains, community assembly, niche evolution and diversification in the plant genus *Rhododendron*.

I received a PhD from University of British Columbia in Canada under the supervision of [Amy Angert](angert.github.io), focusing on ecological niche dynamics in western North American monkeyflowers (*Mimulus* sensu lato). Before this, I received a MS in Ecology (wildlife conservation and monitoring via camera traps) and a BS in Biology from Beijing Normal University in China.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, climbing, and wandering in nature.
