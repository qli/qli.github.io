### Global Change and Biodiversity Conservation

Global change is one major threat to biodiversity on the Earth. How and where climate changes happen need continuous monitoring, quantification, and predictions, across space and time. Most obviously, the global surface temperature has significant increased about roughly 1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900), and is predicted to increase under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Additionally, extreme events become more frequent recently. Consequently, organisms response to global change also needs to be studied along various dimensions. Shifts in species' geographical distributions (expansion, contraction, centroid shift) have been predicted and examined in past decades. We have carried out studies on non-analogous climate patterns and range shifts, and have advanced variable selection and modeling framework in Species Distribution Models (SDM). We aim to continue to work on species range dynamics, range limits, and collectively changes of biodiversity patterns, which would contribute to our effort to biodiversity conservation of our planet.
